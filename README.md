# Rubiks Cube Solver

This project has a suite of Rubik's cube solvers and an interactive virtual Rubik's cube. The main focus of this project is to explore and create solvers to solve different kinds of Rubik's cubes.

This project is web-based and can be accessed at this link: https://16aburnett.github.io/RubiksCubeSolver/

Or you can deploy the page locally with a web server:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:16aburnett/RubiksCubeSolver.git
cd RubiksCubeSolver/
python3 -m http.server 8081
```

Currently, there are solvers for 1x1, 2x2, and 3x3 Rubik's cubes, but more solvers are planned.
